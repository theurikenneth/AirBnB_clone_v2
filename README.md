# AirBnB clone

## Description

HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, it integrates database storage,
a back-end API, and a front-end interface. It is a clone of AirBnB.

## Console

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend
of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by
the application (achieved by calls to the `storage` object).

### How to use the Console

The HolbertonBnB console runs both interactively and non-interactively.
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
```

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the
file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
```

To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```
